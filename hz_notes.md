## Progress
Lots of re-work need to be done to get it working on a different dataset. 
    - Search NOTE in the code to see the changes has been done. 
    - There is still an error on line 78 of embed.py after fixing the data_loader.py. Error says "mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (3104x5 and 4x256)"
